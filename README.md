# No Change Parking

## Business Brief
Drivers are annoyed by our parking meters that only take coins, despite increasing parking charges. The "No Change Parking" system will allow a driver to call us and pay for their parking by credit card. Since there will be no parking ticket for the driver to display on their car, Parking Inspectors must check that a vehicle in the car park is legally parked by querying the vehicle registration number in the system.
